# Production Architecture Rebuild Plan (Option B)

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive brutalist analysis, the current architecture exhibits fundamental failures that guarantee production collapse. This document outlines a complete rebuild strategy addressing every critical vulnerability identified:

- **29% branch coverage** exposing massive error handling gaps
- **Resource consumption by design** through subprocess sprawl and persistent connection overload  
- **Missing safety mechanisms** including circuit breakers, backpressure, and admission control
- **False test confidence** validating non-existent or broken components
- **Cost explosion patterns** with multi-agent execution and unbounded resource usage

The strategic shift moves from "accidental sophistication" to "engineered reliability," implementing production-grade patterns that have proven successful under real-world load conditions.

## Architecture Principles & Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Reliability over Complexity**: Build for failure scenarios, not ideal cases
2. **Bounded Resource Consumption**: Every component has hard limits and graceful degradation
3. **Observable by Design**: Metrics, tracing, and debugging built into core architecture
4. **Security by Default**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation throughout
5. **Fail Fast, Recover Fast**: Quick failure detection with rapid recovery mechanisms

### Design Philosophy Shift

**From**: Sophisticated streaming with complex state management  
**To**: Robust execution with predictable resource consumption

**From**: Multi-agent parallel execution by default  
**To**: Single-agent execution with opt-in parallelization

**From**: Extensive mocking in tests  
**To**: Real component integration with controlled environments

## Core Component Redesign

### 3.1 Circuit Breaker Implementation (Priority 1)

#### Problem Statement
Current architecture lacks circuit breakers entirely, leading to cascade failures when CLI agents become unresponsive or rate-limited.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface CircuitBreakerConfig {
  failureThreshold: number;     // Failures before opening
  recoveryTimeout: Duration;    // Time before attempting recovery
  halfOpenMaxCalls: number;     // Calls allowed in half-open state
  resetTimeout: Duration;       // Time before resetting success count
}

class PerVendorCircuitBreaker {
  private state: CircuitState = CircuitState.CLOSED;
  private failureCount: number = 0;
  private lastFailureTime: number = 0;
  private successCount: number = 0;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Per-vendor circuit breakers** (Claude, Codex, Gemini) with independent failure budgets
- **State management**: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN transitions with configurable thresholds  
- **Fallback strategies**: Cached responses, degraded responses, fail-fast with meaningful errors
- **Metrics integration**: Failure rates, state transitions, recovery timing

#### Success Criteria
- Circuit breaker state transitions under vendor failures
- Fallback response delivery within 100ms
- Vendor recovery detection within one recovery timeout period
- Zero cascade failures during vendor outages

### 3.2 Bounded Async Queue System (Priority 1)

#### Problem Statement  
Current busy-wait concurrency with exponential backoff creates thundering herds and unfair resource allocation.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface QueueConfig {
  maxQueueSize: number;
  maxConcurrent: number;
  timeoutMs: number;
  priorityLevels: number;
}

class BoundedAsyncQueue<T> {
  private queue: PriorityQueue<QueueItem<T>>;
  private activeCount: number = 0;
  private rejectedCount: number = 0;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Replace busy-wait concurrency** with fair, bounded queues
- **Admission control**: Reject requests when queue capacity exceeded
- **Priority handling**: Different queue priorities for different request types
- **Backpressure propagation**: Communicate queue state to upstream callers

#### Success Criteria
- Queue fairness under high load (FIFO within priority levels)
- Fast rejection (< 10ms) when capacity exceeded
- Resource isolation preventing starvation
- Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages

### 3.3 Backpressure-Aware Streaming (Priority 2)

#### Problem Statement
Current streaming emits unlimited events with no flow control, causing notification storms and memory accumulation.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface StreamingConfig {
  maxEventRate: number;         // Events per second limit
  bufferSize: number;           // Maximum buffered events
  coalescingWindowMs: number;   // Event batching window
  dropPolicy: DropPolicy;       // Behavior when buffer full
}

class BackpressureAwareStreaming {
  private eventBuffer: CircularBuffer<StreamEvent>;
  private lastEmitTime: number = 0;
  private droppedEventCount: number = 0;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Producer-consumer pattern** with flow control
- **Event coalescing** under high load to prevent notification storms
- **Circuit breaker integration** to pause streaming when downstream stressed
- **Memory-bounded buffers** with overflow handling

#### Success Criteria
- Event rate limiting under high-frequency outputs
- Memory usage bounded regardless of CLI output volume
- Graceful event dropping with client notification
- Stream recovery after backpressure relief

### 3.4 External State Management (Priority 2)

#### Problem Statement
In-memory session management creates memory leaks and prevents horizontal scaling.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface StateStore {
  setSession(sessionId: string, data: SessionData, ttl: Duration): Promise<void>;
  getSession(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionData | null>;
  setPaginationToken(analysisId: string, token: PaginationToken): Promise<void>;
  getPaginationToken(analysisId: string): Promise<PaginationToken | null>;
  cleanupExpired(): Promise<number>;
}

class RedisStateStore implements StateStore {
  private redis: Redis;
  private keyPrefix: string;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Redis integration** for session state, pagination tokens, and cache coordination
- **Cross-session continuity** for analysis resumption
- **TTL-based cleanup** with automated maintenance
- **Distributed locking** for cache coherency

#### Success Criteria
- Session persistence across server restarts
- Cross-session pagination token continuity
- Automatic cleanup of expired state
- Sub-10ms state access latency

## Security Architecture Overhaul

### 4.1 Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Problem Statement
Disabled argument validation and path leakage in error messages create security vulnerabilities.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface ValidationConfig {
  maxArgLength: number;
  allowedCharacters: RegExp;
  pathWhitelist: string[];
  maxPathDepth: number;
}

class InputValidator {
  validateCLIArguments(args: string[]): ValidationResult;
  validateFilePath(path: string): ValidationResult;
  sanitizeErrorMessage(error: Error): string;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Path traversal prevention** with whitelist validation
- **Argument sanitization** for CLI subprocess execution  
- **Size limits** on all inputs with rejection policies
- **Error message sanitization** to prevent information disclosure

#### Success Criteria
- Zero path traversal vulnerabilities
- All CLI arguments validated before execution
- Error messages contain no sensitive information
- Input validation performance < 1ms per request

### 4.2 Authentication & Authorization Framework

#### Problem Statement
No authentication on HTTP endpoints and permissive CORS policies create security exposure.

#### Solution Architecture
```typescript
interface SecurityConfig {
  sessionTimeout: Duration;
  rateLimitPerSession: number;
  allowedOrigins: string[];
  requireAuthentication: boolean;
}

class SecurityMiddleware {
  authenticateSession(req: Request): Promise<Session | null>;
  authorizeRequest(session: Session, resource: string): boolean;
  rateLimitCheck(sessionId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  auditLog(event: SecurityEvent): void;
}
```

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Session management** with secure token generation and validation
- **Rate limiting** per session/IP with configurable policies
- **CORS hardening** with explicit origin allowlists
- **Audit logging** for security events and access patterns

#### Success Criteria
- All endpoints protected by authentication
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- CORS policy prevents unauthorized origins
- Security events logged and monitored
